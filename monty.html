    <h2>The Problem</h2>
This is a simulation of the famous Monty Hall Problem. Here's the deal:
<ol>
    <li>You're playing a game show where you can potentially win a brand new car.</li>
    <li>The host offers you three doors: Door 1, Door 2, and Door 3.</li>
    <li>You pick one door, but don't open it yet.</li>
    <li>Your host then opens one of the <i>losing</i> doors (these doors commonly hold something that most normal people don't really want, like a goat).</li>
    <li>You are then given the option to stay on your current door or switch to the remaining other closed door.</li>
</ol>
So what's the bettter option? Should you stay? Should you switch? Does it <i>matter</i>?
<hr/>
<h2>The Simulation</h2>
This simulation runs the Monty Hall problem either once ('Run Once!') or a thousand times ('Run a Thousand Times!'). You can change between 'Switch' mode, where the simulated player switches after the host reveals a losing door, and 'Stay' mode, where the simulated player holds his/her ground. Here's a small breakdown of how it works:
<ol>
    <u>Simulation Procedure</u>
    <li>The simulation randomly selects 1, 2 or 3 as the 'winning door'.</li>
    <li>The simulation randomly picks a door for the simulated user to 'pick'. This again is 1, 2 or 3, and is independent of the 'winning door' pick</li>
    <li>Finally, the simulation finds a door that is neither the correct door nor the door selected by the simulated user. This represents the door opened by the host</li>
    <li>An array is then built that holds the remaining, closed doors (i.e., minus the host door).</li>
    <li>If the user has selected switch mode the simulated user switches doors. Otherwise, the simulated user stays.</li>
    <li>Finally, the simulation compares the simulated user's final guess with correct door. Results are stored in an array</li>
</ol>
